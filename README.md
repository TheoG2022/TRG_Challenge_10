### Import the Data (provided in the starter code)
### Prepare the Data (provided in the starter code)

## Second commit

1. Code the elbow method algorithm to find the best value for `k`. Use a range from 1 to 11. 

2. Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of `k` to visually identify the optimal value for `k`.

3. Answer the following question: What is the best value for `k`?

## Third commit

# Initialize the K-Means model with four clusters using the best value for `k`. 

2. Fit the K-Means model using the original data.

3. Predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the original data. View the resulting array of cluster values.

4. Create a copy of the original data and add a new column with the predicted clusters.

5. Create a scatter plot using hvPlot by setting `x="price_change_percentage_24h"` and `y="price_change_percentage_7d"`. Color the graph points with the labels found using K-Means and add the crypto name in the `hover_cols` parameter to identify the cryptocurrency represented by each data point.
